-------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
-------
This repository provides modified/alternative regularization subroutines for use with
the 2D acoustic frequency-domain FWI code TOY2DAC (SEISCOPE Consortium), enabling
edge-preserving update conditioning inspired by rank-order/median regularization.

How to use (TOY2DAC integration)
-------------------------------
1) Choose a 1D or 2D window implementation and replace the corresponding TOY2DAC
   regularization subroutine with the provided "sub_Tikhonov.f90" (or the selected
   variant in this repository).
2) Recompile TOY2DAC.

Parameter settings
------------------
- For 1D windows (directional regularization):
  Set directional weights separately in the TOY2DAC "fwi_input" file:
  - lambda_x : horizontal weight
  - lambda_z : vertical weight

- For 2D window types (isotropic; no directional separation):
  Use either lambda_x or lambda_z > 0 (one is sufficient).
  If both are set > 0, the penalty may be effectively applied twice.

Filter coefficients (optional)
------------------------------
To generate custom filter coefficients, use the MATLAB script:
  "filtCoefficients.m"
and update the selected 1D/2D regularization subroutine accordingly.

IMPORTANT:
The same coefficients must be defined consistently in both:
  - sub_Tikhonov_fgrad
  - sub_Tikhonov_Hv
